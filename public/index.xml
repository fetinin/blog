      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve likely been in this situation before. You make some minor code fixes, do &lt;code&gt;git commit --ammend&lt;/code&gt; to add them to the current commit, and do &lt;code&gt;git push --force&lt;/code&gt;. Then, you happily open pull request and see that you&amp;rsquo;ve deleted you&amp;rsquo;re colleagues commit.😩&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Fundamentals of software architecture is a book by Mark Richards and Neal Ford — hands-on practitioners who have taught software architecture classes professionally for years—focus on architecture principles that apply across all technology stacks.
This book left me with good basis of what role software architect plays in a company and extended my knowledge of different architecture patterns. In the following series of articles I&amp;rsquo;ll write about topics from this book that I liked most.</description>
