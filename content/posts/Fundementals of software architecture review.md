 > 
 > When reading about architecture readers must keep in mind that, like much art, it can only be understood in context.

 > 
 > Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
 > 
 > * First Law of Software Architecture
 >   If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade-off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet.

 > 
 > Why is more important than how.
 > 
 > * Second Law of Software Architecture

 > 
 > Never shoot for the best architecture, but rather the least worst architecture.

 > 
 > There are no wrong answers in architecture, only expensive ones.

 > 
 > Orchestration is the coordination of multiple services through the use of a separate mediator service that controls and manages the workflow of the transaction (like a conductor in an orchestra).

 > 
 > Choreography, on the other hand, is the coordination of multiple services by which each service talks to one another without the use of a central mediator (like dancers in a dance).

 > 
 > When calling a meeting, an architect should always try to schedule meetings either first thing in the morning, right after lunch, or toward the end of the day, but not during the day when most developers experience flow state.

 > Technology breadth is more important to architects than depth.

It's hard to find time to keep up with the latest trends, but you can at least spend 20 minutes a day to read technological news aggregators such as [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/), [DZone](https://dzone.com/) [Refcardz](https://dzone.com/refcardz), and the [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).
