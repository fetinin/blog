# Hi, I'm Denis 💁🏻‍♂️💻

Golang and Python developer who secretly loves frontend, but most of the time works as a backend developer at [Lamoda](https://latech.ru/).

I have experience with microservices and event-driven architecture. I work in E-commerce on app and website backends, as well as 20+ microservices that provide discounts and coupons, catalog navigation, checkout, cart, and other features for our customers.

I enjoy working in small to medium teams and helping to understand business requirements, plan and document architecture, decompose tasks, code, and get things done. Always happy to help my colleagues.
