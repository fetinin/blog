# Hi, I'm Denis 💁🏻‍♂️💻

Golang and Python developer who secretly loves frontend, but most of the time works as a backend developer at [UCB](https://bki-okb.ru/).

I have experience with microservices and event-driven architecture. I've worked in e-commerce on app and website backends, as well as over 20 microservices that provide discounts and coupons, catalog navigation, checkout, cart, and other features for our customers.

I enjoy working in small to medium teams and helping to understand business requirements. I can assist in planning and documenting architecture, decomposing tasks, writing code, and getting things done. I'm always happy to help my colleagues.
